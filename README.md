# SEO Plan Feature To-Do List

## **Project Goal:**
To create an AI-powered SEO Plan feature that generates keywords and on-page recommendations based on a user's product name and description.

### üü¢ **Backend Developer **

#### **Phase 1: Data & Core Logic**

* [ ] **Set up NLP pipeline:** Choose and integrate a suitable NLP library (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) to analyze text input.
* [ ] **Integrate with Keyword API:** Connect the backend to a reliable keyword data provider (like Moz, Ahrefs, or a similar API) to get search volume and difficulty scores.
* [ ] **Develop the `generate_keywords` function:**
    * This function will take the product name and description as input.
    * Use NLP to identify core themes, features, and pain points.
    * Formulate intelligent queries to send to the keyword API.
    * Return a structured JSON object containing primary, long-tail, and question keywords with their respective metrics.
* [ ] **Develop the `generate_on_page_recommendations` function:**
    * This function will take the generated keywords as input.
    * Use a large language model (LLM) or a rule-based system to generate title tags, meta descriptions, and content outlines for each keyword.
    * Ensure the output is also a structured JSON object.

#### **Phase 2: API Integration & Testing**

* [ ] **Create the SEO Plan API Endpoint:** Design and build a new endpoint (e.g., `/api/seo-plan`) that the frontend can call. This endpoint should trigger both backend functions and return the complete SEO plan.
* [ ] **Write Unit & Integration Tests:** Test all functions and the API endpoint to ensure they return accurate data and handle different inputs correctly.

### üîµ **Frontend Developer **

#### **Phase 1: UI/UX & User Flow**

* [ ] **Design the "Generate SEO Plan" page:** Create a new page or section in the app where the user can input the product name and description.
* [ ] **Build the input form:** Create two input fields for "Product Name" and "Product Description" and a "Generate Plan" button. Include a loading state (e.g., a spinner) to show when the AI is working.

#### **Phase 2: Data Handling & Display**

* [ ] **Call the Backend API:** On button click, make an API call to the new `/api/seo-plan` endpoint.
* [ ] **Display the results:** Parse the JSON data received from the backend.
* [ ] **Design and build the results view:**
    * Use clear headings for "Keyword Research" and "On-Page Recommendations."
    * Create a clean, easy-to-read layout to display the keyword lists (e.g., tables or styled cards).
    * Format the on-page recommendations with clear labels (e.g., "Title Tag," "Meta Description") and use bold text to highlight keywords within the suggestions.
* [ ] **Add a "Copy" button:** Place a button next to each suggestion (like a meta description) so users can easily copy the text.

### ü§ù **Collaborative Tasks**

* [ ] **Define API contract:** Sit down together to agree on the exact JSON structure the backend will send and the frontend expects. This is crucial for a smooth workflow.
* [ ] **Review and refine:** After the initial build, test the feature together. Check the quality of the AI's output and make adjustments as needed.
* [ ] **Plan for scalability:** Discuss how the feature will handle a large number of requests and potential future additions, like the competitor analysis feature.

### üöÄ **Launch Checklist**

* [ ] Internal QA testing.
* [ ] User feedback collection plan.
* [ ] Write a blog post announcing the new feature.
